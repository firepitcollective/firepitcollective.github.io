title: Jay Terrestrial and the Firepit Collective
email: info@innerterrestrials.co.uk
description: A blend of modern and traditional music along with jigs and reels; folk music has been taken in, anarchised and re-processed with a real hard political edge. Jay Terrestrial and the Firepit Collective have a large and enthusiastic fanbase who never fail to liven up the venues where they play.
